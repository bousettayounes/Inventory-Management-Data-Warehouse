# Inventory-Management-Data-Warehouse
This project implements a robust Inventory Management Data Warehouse using modern data engineering tools. It leverages dbt (data build tool) for data transformation and Apache Airflow for orchestration and scheduling.

This project implements a robust Inventory Management Data Warehouse using modern data engineering tools. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing and analyzing inventory data at scale.
Tools Used

dbt (data build tool): Used for data transformation, enabling us to write, document, and execute SQL-based data transformations.
Apache Airflow: Handles orchestration and scheduling of our data pipelines, ensuring timely and reliable data processing.

## Features : 

- Automated data ingestion from various sources
- Data cleaning and standardization
- Complex data transformations using dbt
- Scheduled data updates via Airflow
- Comprehensive data modeling for inventory analysis
- Easy-to-query data structures for business intelligence tools

This Inventory Management Data Warehouse project demonstrates the power of modern data engineering tools in creating a scalable, maintainable, and efficient data solution.
