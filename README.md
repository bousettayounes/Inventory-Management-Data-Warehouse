This project implements a robust Inventory Management Data Warehouse using modern data engineering tools. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing and analyzing inventory data at scale.
Tools Used

- dbt (data build tool): Used for data transformation, enabling us to write, document, and execute SQL-based data transformations.
- Apache Airflow: Handles orchestration and scheduling of our data pipelines, ensuring timely and reliable data processing.
- Docker: Enables easy local deployment of the entire architecture, ensuring consistency across different environments.

## Features : 

- Automated data ingestion from various sources
- Data cleaning and standardization
- Complex data transformations using dbt
- Scheduled data updates via Airflow
- Comprehensive data modeling for inventory analysis
- Easy-to-query data structures for business intelligence tools
- Containerized architecture for simplified deployment and scaling

This Inventory Management Data Warehouse project demonstrates the power of modern data engineering tools in creating a scalable, maintainable, and efficient data solution. By leveraging dbt for transformations and Airflow for orchestration, we've created a robust system that can handle complex inventory data with ease. 
Whether you're looking to optimize stock levels, analyze product performance, or gain deeper insights into your inventory, this data warehouse provides the foundation you need.
